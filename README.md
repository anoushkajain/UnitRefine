# UnitRefine: A Community Toolbox for Automated Spike Sorting Curation  

**UnitRefine** is a machine-learning-based toolbox designed to streamline spike sorting curation by reducing the need for manual intervention.  

With a focus on accessibility and broad community adoption, UnitRefine offers:  
- Seamless integration with **SpikeInterface**.  
- Pre-trained machine learning models for effortless application.  
- The flexibility to train custom models using your own curated datasets and metrics.  
- Easy sharing of trained models via **Hugging Face Hub**, fostering collaboration and reproducibility.  

## Key Features  
1. **Pre-trained Models**: Apply ready-to-use classifiers for noise removal and unit refinement.  
2. **Custom Training**: Train models on your own data to meet specific experimental needs.  
3. **Integration**: Fully integrated with SpikeInterface for a smooth user experience.  
4. **Collaboration**: Share or download models from the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/collections/SpikeInterface/curation-models-66ebf53d7f17088991062c2c), enabling community-driven advancements.


## Getting Started  
### Installation  
Ensure that **SpikeInterface** is installed in your environment. Installation instructions can be found [here](https://spikeinterface.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get_started/installation.html).  

### Tutorials  
To get started with UnitRefine, refer to the automated curation tutorials available in the SpikeInterface documentation:  
[Automated Curation Tutorials](https://spikeinterface.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials_custom_index.html#automated-curation-tutorials)  

Additionally, this repository includes **Jupyter Notebooks** with detailed step-by-step tutorials on how to:  
1. Apply pre-trained models.  
2. Train your own classifiers.
