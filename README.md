# UnitRefine: A community toolbox for automated spike sorting curation
UnitRefine, a classification toolbox that leverages diverse machine-learning algorithms to minimize manual curation efforts.

UnitRefine is specifically developed for broad community adoption, easy to use, and fully integrated into SpikeInterface,
allowing users to either apply our pre-trained models or generate new decoders based on their own curation.
New models can also be trained on custom metrics and easily shared via HuggingFaceHub.
