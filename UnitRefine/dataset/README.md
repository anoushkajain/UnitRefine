## Curated Dataset for Neural Activity Classification

A manually curated dataset is available, annotated by a team of seven curators using data from 11 Neuropixels 1.0 recordings in mice.
Key details include:

- **Annotation Process**: Each recording was reviewed by 2 to 5 curators, with an overall agreement rate of 80% among the curators.
- **Consensus-Based Labels**: Units included in the dataset were selected based on the majority agreement among curators, ensuring high-quality annotations.

This dataset provides a reliable benchmark for evaluating and validating neural activity classification models.
