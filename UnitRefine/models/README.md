## Models for Unit Classification

Pre-trained machine learning models to streamline the classification of neural activity. The following models are available:

- **`noise_neural_classifier`**: Distinguishes between noise and neural signals.
- **`sua_mua_classifier`**: Differentiates between single-unit activity (SUA) and multi-unit activity (MUA).

These models are designed to integrate seamlessly with the SpikeInterface pipeline, making it easier to curate and analyze large-scale electrophysiological datasets.

You can access and download these models from the [SpikeInterface Curation Models Collection on Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/collections/SpikeInterface/curation-models-66ebf53d7f17088991062c2c).
