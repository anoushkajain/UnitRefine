### Tutorials  

Ensure that **SpikeInterface** is installed in your environment. Installation instructions can be found [here](https://spikeinterface.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get_started/installation.html).

To get started with UnitRefine, refer to the automated curation tutorials available in the SpikeInterface documentation:  
[Automated Curation Tutorials](https://spikeinterface.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials_custom_index.html#automated-curation-tutorials)  

Additionally, this repository includes **Jupyter Notebooks** with detailed step-by-step tutorials on how to:  
1. Apply **pre-trained models** in apply model folder.  
2. **Train your own classifiers** in train model folder.

Each section contains 2 example notebooks to use UnitRefine with either a sorting analyzer object from Spikeinterface or with pre-computed metrics that can be loaded as a .csv file. Sorting analyzer objects are recommended and also compatible with the UnitRefine GUI workflow whereas pre-computed metrics allow integrating UnitRefine into already established custom workflows.
